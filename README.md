# face_detecting_prototype

This is a prototype for face detecting. Including the OpenCV framework and the Kairos API it is able to *read* or *detect* faces.
This prototype is my first time coding python and my first try in face detection. If you have suggestions for improvement let me know.

#### How to run it
To run my prototype you have to pull it to your computer.
If you have installed python you can run it simply with the command `python write.py` or `python verify.py`

#### Dependecies
With python3 you have to install variable dependencies.

- Numpy `pip install numpy`
- Requests `pip install requests`
- base64 / json no insatallation needed
- opencv `pip install opencv.wheel` -> find your [.wheel File here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv) 

You also have to sign in on [Kairos](https://www.kairos.com/) and get an `id` and a `key` there.
This properties you have to paste into their placeholder.

#### Try it

After you have finished the preparation let's try it. Take a computer with webcam, rename your gallery and source,
*write* your face into kairos and check if it recognizes you. Enjoy!
